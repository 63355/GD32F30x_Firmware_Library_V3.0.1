  This example is based on the GD32F303E-EVAL board,it provides a description of 
how to use the USBFS peripheral.

  The GD32 device is enumerated as an USB Custom HID device for IAP, that uses the 
native PC Host HID driver.

  To test the demo, user need a configuration hex image or bin image. The hex image
or the bin image should set application address at 0x8008000. You can refer to 
"Utilities/Binary/DFU_Images" folder and use the hex images or bin images in it.

  To test the demo, you need to:
    - Download the "GD32AllInOneProgrammer" PC applet
    - Start the "GD32AllInOneProgrammer" PC applet, the interface select "USB" and the application class select"IAP"
    - The device should be detected and shown in the PC applet
    - Select the hex image,configure the target download address and download it to the flash
    - if user check "jump to run the App program", the mcu will run the new application

    - After each device reset, hold down the TAMPER key on the GD32F303E-EVAL board 
      to enter IAP mode
